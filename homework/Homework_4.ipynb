    "<b>Due date</b>: 11pm, Wednesday May 2nd\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission method</b>: see LMS\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 5% of mark for class\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Overview</b>: In this homework, you'll be creating an 'artificial intelligence' player for the classic Hangman word guessing game. You will need to implement several different automatic strategies based on character level language models, ranging from unigram approaches to higher over n-gram models. Your objective is to create an automatic player which makes the fewest mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Gensim. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Extra credit</b>: Each homework has a task which is optional with respect to getting full marks on the assignment, but that can be used to offset any points lost on this or any other homework assignment (but not the final project or the exam). We recommend you skip over this step on your first pass, and come back if you have time: the amount of effort required to receive full marks (1 point) on an extra credit question will be substantially more than earning the same amount of credit on other parts of the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the University’s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

    "**Instructions:** Now for the main challenge, using a *ngram* language model over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your job is to develop a *ngram* language model over characters, train this over the training words (being careful to handle the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with sentinel symbols.) You should use linear interpolation to smooth between the higher order and lower order models, and you will have to decide how to weight each component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your guessing AI algorithm should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using as much of the left context as is known. E.g., in `_ e c _ e _ _` we know the full left context for the first blank (context=start of word), we have a context of two characters for the second blank (context=ec), one character for the second last blank (context=e), and no known context for the last one. If we were using a *n=3* order model, we would be able to apply it to the first and second blanks, but would only be able to use the bigram or unigram distributions for the subsequent blanks. As with the unigram model, you should sum over the probability distributions for each blank to find the expected count for each character type, then select the  character with the highest expected count.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the ngram method for *n=3,4* and *5* and evaluate each of these three models over the test set. Do you see any improvement over the unigram methods above?\n",
